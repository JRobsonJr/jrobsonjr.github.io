                <h1 class="f1">About me</h1>
                <p>I was born 19 years ago in <b>Patos</b>, a small town in the state of Para√≠ba, Brazil, where I
                    lived for most part of my life. When I turned 17, I had to move to another city, <b>Campina
                        Grande</b>, because the university where I had always wanted to study was located there. By
                    the way, it's the <b>Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG)</b> I'm talking about.
                <p>Even though I had never had any experience with programming at all, I chose to study
                    <b>Computer Science</b> because of my affinity with mathematics, videogames and computers.
                    Yes, that's probably not a good enough reason in most cases, and yes, I decided where I
                    wanted to study before deciding what I wanted to do, which is not very usual. In spite of
                    this, it's working and I'm in love with what I'm getting to learn!</p>
                <p>Currently, I'm a <b>researcher/developer</b> at two laboratories based in my university: the
                    Software Practices Laboratory (SPLab) and the Distributed Systems Laboratory (LSD). I work
                    in a project called <b>MaaS (Metal as a Service)</b>, which is a partnership between those
                    labs, RedHat and Lenovo. I've been there for more than one year already, and I've grown
                    interest specially (but not only) in developing web applications and researching.</p>

                <h1 class="f1">However...</h1>
                <p>There's many other things that I love doing, such as</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Writing</b>
                    <br>I'm always doing it, consciously or not. I've decided that if an idea pops out of nowhere,
                    I have better write it down before it fades away (and I've learnt that the hard way).
                    <br>
                    <b>Playing videogames</b>
                    <br>Mostly Nintendo 3DS and computer games. I've also written about games for a few years for
                    <a href="https://nintendoblast.com.br" target="_blank">Nintendo Blast</a>.
                    <br>
                    <b>Composing</b>
                    <br>Well, I try. I still need to learn a lot of basics on that, like how to think of melody
                    before lyrics or to be able to play an instrument. In the meantime, I'm working on creating
                    myself a respectful database of poems and song ideas.
                    <br>
                    <b>Researching, reading, learning</b>
                    <br>I spend hours doing these. As a result, I can probably name you every song Taylor Swift
                    has ever released, which is something I should not be proud of. But I do learn nice things
                    now and then and I think that's what we all should be doing.

                <p>If you've been paying attention, you might have noticed a pattern here... There's

                <h1 class="f1">Music.</h1>
                <p>I'm listening to music all the time. When I love a piece of music, I listen to it over and
                    over and over and... over again.</p>
                <p>I'm pretty sure you can learn a lot about someone just by looking at the music they
                    listen to the most. With that said, if you're interested in getting to know me better, here are
                    some indications:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a target="_blank"
                            href="https://open.spotify.com/user/jrobsonjr/playlist/1K28FlYFq6NfwD61GKAXIr?si=FMMwA3UuTUmuWr9CJwCNfA">
                            Here's a Spotify playlist</a> containing some of my all-time faves!</li>
                    <li>My favorite album that's been released in 2018 is Infections Of A Different Kind (Step I),
                        by
                        Norwergian singer/songwriter/fairy AURORA.</li>
                    <li>In 2017, I've spent more than 54 days listening to music. In 2018, I had already overcome
                        this by around September.</li>
                    <li>Lorde's Melodrama and Taylor Swift's Red are probably my favorite LPs of all time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Okay, that's enough. I'm also going to drop my Spotify and Last.fm accounts here... Just in
                    case.</p>
