                    <p class="lead">As I previously stated, my name is Robson.</p>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Patos, Paraíba, Brazil. When I turned 17, I had to move to another
                        city (Campina Grande,
                        Paraíba, Brazil) because the university where I had always wanted to study was located
                        there. By the way, I'm talking
                        about the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG). Even though I had never had any
                        experience with programming
                        at all, I chose to study Computer Science because of my affinity with mathematics,
                        videogames and computers. Yes,
                        that's probably not a good enough reason in most cases, and yes, I decided where I wanted
                        to study before deciding
                        what I wanted to do. In spite of this, it's working and I'm in love with I'm getting to
                        learn!</p>
                    <p>Currently, I'm a researcher at two laboratories based in my university: the Software
                        Practices Laboratory (SPLab)
                        and the Distributed Systems Laboratory (LSD). I work in a project called MaaS (Metal as a
                        Service), which is a
                        partnership between these labs, RedHat and Lenovo.</p>
                    <p>I'm also a freelance writer at Nintendo Blast.</p>
                    <p>You get to know more about these things as you continue to scroll down!</p>

                    <p>
                        <b>Writing</b>
                        <br>I'm always doing it, consciously or not.
                        <br>
                        <b>Playing videogames</b>
                        <br>Mostly 3DS and computer games.
                        <br>
                        <b>Composing</b>
                        <br>Well, I try. Yet I still need to learn a lot of basics on that.
                        <br>
                        <b>Researching, reading, learning</b>
                        <br>I spend hours doing these. As a result, I can probably name you every song Taylor Swift
                        has ever released or tell
                        you the Metascore of most recently released pop albums (not exactly something I should be
                        proud of, though).
                        But sometimes I do learn interesting stuff and I think that's what we should all be doing.

                    <p>I'm listening to music all the time. When I love a piece of music, I listen to it over and
                        over. That's why I keep
                        artists such as Taylor Swift, Lorde, Sia, Bridgit Mendler, Grace VanderWaal, Katy Perry,
                        Bleachers, Aurora, Ed
                        Sheeran and Lady Gaga constantly on repeat. (And I didn't mention these names at random —
                        they're the artists I've
                        listened the most during last year.)</p>
                    <p>I'm pretty sure you can learn a thing or two about me just by looking at the music I listen
